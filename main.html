  <h2>Introduction to Synchronization (part I)</h2>

    [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Synchronization,Synchronization]
    is found throughout science and engineering
    ([http://books.google.com/books?id=a4bfvTMvYpcC, link]).
    Synchronization of cicada (biology) and clocks (physics) and
    clapping (psycology) are well known
    ([http://books.google.com/books?id=FuIv845q3QUC,link]). In mobile
    phones, the synchronization of a high-frequency (GHz) oscillator
    to a low-frequency (MHz) reference is essential---and the unwanted
    synchronization of high-frequency oscillators is a curse. While
    the detail of synchronization may be very technical, the basic
    ideas can be quickly grasped.

    What, then, do such diverse examples of synchronization (from
    physics, engineering, biology, psycology, ...) have in common?
    What are the *universal* properties of synchronization---and how
    can they be understood at an intuitive level? To address these
    questions (at least, to make a start) we consider the most simple
    case---phase synchronization of an oscillator by an enternal
    sinusoidal disturbance at the same

    What as "oscillator" is depends on your background. In
    electronics, an oscillator typically comprises an inductor and
    capacitor, where (electrical) energy in the capacitor is
    periodically exchanged with (magnetic) energy in the
    inductor. Energy sloshes back an forth at the resonant frequency,
    and a power supply compensates for the inevitable losses. In other
    fields the details differ --- but the important aspects are the
    same. A metronome periodically exchanges kinetic energy and
    potential energy as the pendulum swings --- and its
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapement,escapement] replaces any
    losses.
    
    The main thing is that an "oscillator" has two states (say
    capacitor voltage and inductor current, or pendulum height and
    speed), and initial condition achieves a stable, periodic
    oscillation. Then, plotting one against the other in a
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_portrait,phase portrait], we
    see a limit cycle (see Van der Pol box).

      The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Pol_oscillator,Van der
      Pol oscillator] is a good
      [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_problem,toy problem] for
      synchronization:
      
      $$ \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}-\mu \left(1-x^2 \right) \frac{dx}{dt} + x =
      0 $$

      If $x$ is one state and $y$ is the other, then two state
      equations are $dx/dt=y$ and $dy/dt=\mu(1-x^2)y-x$.  Code to
      integrate these equations is below (edit, then ctrl-enter to
      run). It is instructive, for example, to change the nonlinearity
      parameter (i.e., the nonlinear damping), $\mu$, and note how $x$
      and $y$ are become nearly sinusoidal for $\mu \ll 1$.

      Showing the partial (finite time) trajector of randomly chosen
      initial states (colored dots, below left) gives a better idea of
      how the attractor works.  <span id = "intro-start-button" class

      The larger black dot shows a single initial condition that has
      become trapped on the limit-cycle.  The second plot (below,
      right) shows the evolution of the two coordinates of the black
      dot (i.e., the $x$ and $y$). To study synchronization its
      easiest to consider quasi-linear operation with $\mu<1$ ---
      where the limit cycle tends towards the grey circle.

  <h3 style="margin-top: 25px;">Disturbances</h3> 

  The oscillator's trajectory in the phase-portrait can be altered by
  an external disturbance.  In practical terms, for instance,
  electronic oscillators are often disturbed by coupling via finite
  ground impedances which change the capacitor voltage (see also
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_locking, injection
  locking]).

  Note, though, that this is different from Huygens classic example of
  two coupled clocks --- in that case the oscillators (clocks)
  *mutually* affect each other. Here we consider that the disturbance
  in one direction. The disturbance affects the oscillator, but the
  oscillator does not affect the disturbance.

   <div class="left_col">

    Synchronization is essentially about how an oscillator responds to
    (often periodic) disturbances.  Thus, before considering
    synchronization itself, we must know something of how oscillators
    respond to external influence.  The phase-portrait on the right
    corresponds to a quasi-linear ($\mu=0.1$) Van der Pol oscillator.  The black
    marker is on the limit-cycle.  Say an intantaneous (impulsive)
    disturbance knocks the black marker to the red marker---a 45
    degree rotation and attenuation by half.  To see how the nominal
    and disturbed points evolve: <span id="dist-start-button"
    class="text-button">start</span> (then <span id="dist-stop-button"
    class ="text-button">stop</span> or <span id="dist-scenario-1"
    class="text-button">reset</span>).

    The key observation is that the rotation (approximately 45 degree)
    part of the disturbance persists, but the amplitude part
    dissappears. This example is on a grossly large scale---but its
    easy to imagine that for typically small disturbances the
    oscillator's phase (its position on the limit cycle) is easy to
    disturb, but the amplitude is restored by the nonlinearity. Feel
    free to test this idea by stopping the oscillator, then dragging
    the red and black markers (and restarting of course).

  <h3>Synchronization</h3>

  <div class="left_col">

    We turn to phase synchronization armed with a critical idea: only
    the part of the disturbace that is tangential to the limit cycle
    is important. To explore further, consider the effect of a
    vertical, sinusoidal disturbance---with the same period as the
    oscillator---on the circular limit-cycle oscillator
    below <span id="osc-start-button" class="text-button">click to
    start</span>.

    Initially, we consider only the *potential* influence of the
    disturbance, without allowing any actual effect. In particular,
    paying attention to the phase of the disturbance with respect to
    the phase of the oscillator. For instance, the position of the
    oscillator on the limit cycle when the disturbance peaks.
    
  </div>

  <div class="right_col">

    The (sinusoidal) disturbance's peak---being independent of the
    oscillator---are like the ticks of a clock. For clarity in the
    figure below we mark the peak with a red circle.  At any tick the
    oscillator's phase (position on the limit cycle) could potentially
    be anywhere---depending on where it started, or how it was
    influenced by the disturbance.

    Below, it is clear that the oscillator is being pulled in an
    anti-clockwise direction. This is confirmed by the green trace on
    the right, showing the tangential disturbance---which is always
    negative (acting anti-clockwise). Less obvious is that the
    tangential force depends on the position of the red circle---that
    is, the relative phase of the oscillator and disturbance.

  </div>

  <div class="clear"></div>

  <div id="sync-container" class="container">

    <div id="sync-scope"></div>
    <div id="cw-label">Anti-clockwise force</div>
    <div id="acw-label">Clockwise force</div>
  </div>

  <div class="clear" style="margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

  <div class="left_col">

    Say that the disturbance rotates the oscillator phase
    anti-clockwise a little: <span id="osc-acw-button"
    class="text-button">click &#8634;</span>. (You can also move the
    phase clockwise <span id="osc-acw-button"
    class="text-button">click &#8635;</span>,
    or <span id="osc-stop-button" class="text-button">stop</span> the
    oscillator altogther). The red circle moves anti-clockwise (i.e.,
    the disturbance peaks at a new position on the limit-cycle).  Note
    what happens to the the tangential force---the green trace has
    moved upwards and the average force (over a cycle) is *less*. Keep
    clicking to make the effect more obvious.

    Notice that when the red circle is at the top of the limit-cycle
    (i.e., say the oscilltor phase has been encouraged by the
    disturbance into that position) there is zero *average* tengential
    force on the oscillator. That is, the disturbance (on average)
    will not tend to move the oscillator phase in either direction.

  </div>

  <div class="right_col">

    Furthermore, if the red circle moves anti-clockwise past the top
    of the limit-cycle the average force is *clockwise*---pushing it
    back towards the top. Thus, the disturbance always encourages the
    oscillator phase to be at the the top of the limit cycle when the
    disturbance peaks. Said another way, the oscillator phase is
    *locked* to the disturbance.
