  <div class="left_col">
    What is synchronization?

    adjustment of rhythms of oscillators due to their weak interaction

    What is an oscillator? E.g., electronic (Collpits etc., lasers), 
    mechanical (clocks, pendulum); biology (fireflys ...). All have
    a few things in common: active; robust to IC;
    characterized by period $T$. Van der Pol = canonical model.
    (Toy problem?). Dyncamial system. Autonomous, self-sustained, 
    self/auto-oscillatory

    [The main universal property is that these are all active systems that taken apart, or being isolated, continue to oscillate in their own rhythms.]
 
    What is coupling? E.g., Huygens clocks. Oscillator pulling in 
    mobile phones. Periodic disturbance. Consider one-direction only
    here. Depends on coupling strength and freq separation.

    Types of synchronization: by external coupling; mutual coupling;
    populations of oscillators (see part II).

  <div class="right_col">

    Geometrical view of oscillator: limit cycle. Need two states.
    (e.g., electrical & magnetic energy, or kinetic and potential)
    Quasi-linear (circular-ish).

    Amplitude is stabe --- phase is free.
