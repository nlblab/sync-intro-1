    Examples of synchronization are found throughout science and engineering X. 
    Synchronization of cicada (biology X) and clocks (physics X) and clapping
    (psycology X) are well known. In mobile phones, the synchronization of a
    high-frequency (GHz) oscillator to a low-frequency (MHz) reference is
    essential. While the detail of synchronization may be *very* technical, it is
    quite possible to quicky appreciate its broad ideas with an intuitive grasp of
    dynamic systems (limit cycles in particular). Here we follow the first part 
    of [X], "Synchronization without formulae". 
    
    The question (as ever) is what do such differing examples of synchronization
    (from physics, engineering, biology, psycology, ...) have in common? That is, 
    what are the *universal* properties of synchronization that do not depend on 
    a particular system? To address these questions (at least, to make a start) 
    we consider the most simple case --- an oscillator synchonized by an enternal force.

    What as "oscillator" is to you will depend on your background. In electronics,
    an oscillator typically comprises an inductor and capacitor, where (electrical)
    energy in the capacitor is periodically exchanged with (magnetic) energy in the
    inductor. Energy sloshes back an forth at the resonant frequency, and a power
    supply compensates for the inevitable losses. In other fields the details will
    differ --- but the important aspects are the same. For example, a metronome
    periodically exchanges kinetic energy and potential energy as the pendulum
    swings --- and its escapement replaces any losses.
    
    For us, the main thing is that an "oscillator" has two states (say capacitor
    voltage and inductor current, or pendulum height and speed), and from any
    initial condition we end up with a stable, periodic oscillation. Furthermore,
    because each state is periodic, if we plot one against the other in a
    phase plane we see a limit cycle.

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Van der Pol Oscillator</h3>
    <div class="box-text">
      The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Pol_oscillator,Van der Pol oscillator]
      is just complex enough to be a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_problem,toy problem]
      for synchronization:
      $$
      \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}-\mu \left(1-x^2 \right) \frac{dx}{dt} + x = 0 
      $$
      If we set one state to be $x$ and the other $y=dx/dt$ we find the state behavior shown
      on the lower left (states as a function of time appear on the lower right). 
      The phase-space is illustrated by the colored dots, which show 
      the trajectory of random initial states for a finite time. The black dot shows a 
      single initial condition that has become trapped on the limit-cycle.

      The slider controls $\mu$, the nonlinearity---$\mu=0$ corresponds to simple harmonic
      motion (without a limit cycle), and large $\mu$ tends towards a 
      [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_oscillator, relaxation oscillator].
      To study synchronization its easiest to consider quasi-linear operation with
      $\mu<1$ --- where the limit cycle tends towards the grey circle.

  <h3>External Force</h3>
  
  <div class="left_col">

    An "enternal force" on an oscillator is something that disturbs its
    trajectory in the phase space. In practical terms, for instance, electronic 
    oscillators are often disturbed by coupling via finite ground
    impedances. 

  </div>

  <div class="right_col">

    Note, though, that this is different from Huygens classic
    example of two coupled clocks --- in this case the oscillators (clocks)
    mutually affect each other. The influence of an external force is
    thus only in one direction -- the oscillator does not affect the force.

    <h3>Disturbances</h3>
    The oscillator on the right is quasi-linear ($\mu=0.05$). The red and black
    markers show the evolution of two initial conditions. You can 
    <span id="dist-stop-button" class="text-button">stop</span> the simulation 
    at any time, reposition the markers, then 
    <span id="dist-start-button" class="text-button">restart</span>.

    To understand the effect of a disturbance on the oscillator it is instructive
    to consider black marker as the nominal solution, and the red marker  as the 
    perturbed solution (as if knocked off-course by an impulse). For examaple, say 
    the nominal (black) solution is on the limit cycle, and the perturbation
    reduces the amplitude by half and increases the phase by 45 degrees.
