    Examples of synchronization are found throughout science and engineering X. 
    Synchronization of cicada (biology X) and clocks (physics X) and clapping
    (psycology X) are well known. In mobile phones, the synchronization of a
    high-frequency (GHz) oscillator to a low-frequency (MHz) reference is
    essential. While the detail of synchronization may be *very* technical, it is
    quite possible to quicky appreciate its broad ideas with an intuitive grasp of
    dynamic systems (limit cycles in particular). Here we follow the first part 
    of [X], "Synchronization without formulae". 

    The question (as ever) is what do such differing examples of synchronization
    (from physics, engineering, biology, psycology, ...) have in common? That is, 
    what are the *universal* properties of synchronization that do not depend on 
    a particular system? To address these questions (at least, to make a start) 
    we consider the most simple case --- an oscillator synchonized by an enternal force.

    What as "oscillator" is to you will depend on your background. In electronics,
    an oscillator typically comprises an inductor and capacitor, where (electrical)
    energy in the capacitor is periodically exchanged with (magnetic) energy in the
    inductor. Energy sloshes back an forth at the resonant frequency, and a power
    supply compensates for the inevitable losses. In other fields the details will
    differ --- but the important aspects are the same. For example, a metronome
    periodically exchanges kinetic energy and potential energy as the pendulum
    swings --- and its escapement replaces any losses.
    
    For us, the main thing is that an "oscillator" has two states (say capacitor
    voltage and inductor current, or pendulum height and speed), and from any
    initial condition we end up with a stable, periodic oscillation. Furthermore,
    because each state is periodic, if we plot one against the other in a
    phase plane we see a limit cycle.

    What is coupling? E.g., Huygens clocks. Oscillator pulling in 
    mobile phones. Periodic disturbance. Consider one-direction only
    here. Depends on coupling strength and freq separation.

    Types of synchronization: by external coupling; mutual coupling;
    populations of oscillators (see part II).

    Geometrical view of oscillator: limit cycle. Need two states.
    (e.g., electrical & magnetic energy, or kinetic and potential)
    Quasi-linear (circular-ish).

    Amplitude is stabe --- phase is free.
