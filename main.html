  <h2>Introduction to Synchronization (part I)</h2>


  <div class="left_col">
    
    [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Synchronization,Synchronization]
    is found throughout science and engineering (see,
    e.g. [http://books.google.com/books?id=FuIv845q3QUC,link] and
    [http://books.google.com/books?id=a4bfvTMvYpcC, link]).
    Synchronization of cicada (biology) and clocks (physics) and
    clapping (psycology) are well known. In mobile phones, the
    synchronization of a high-frequency (GHz) oscillator to a
    low-frequency (MHz) reference is essential
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop, link]. While the
    detail of synchronization is technical, the basic ideas can be
    quickly grasped wih a modest understanding of dynamic systems.

    What do such diverse examples of synchronization (from physics,
    engineering, biology, psycology, ...) have in common? What are the
    *universal* properties of synchronization (that do not depend on
    the specifics of a particular system)---and how can they be
    understood at an intuitive level? To address these questions (at
    least, to make a start) we consider the most simple case---phase
    synchronization of an oscillator by an enternal force at the same
    frequency.

    What as "oscillator" is depends on your background. In
    electronics, an oscillator typically comprises an inductor and
    capacitor, where (electrical) energy in the capacitor is
    periodically exchanged with (magnetic) energy in the
    inductor. Energy sloshes back an forth at the resonant frequency,
    and a power supply compensates for the inevitable losses. In other
    fields the details differ --- but the important aspects are the
    same. A metronome periodically exchanges kinetic energy and
    potential energy as the pendulum swings --- and its escapement
    replaces any losses.
    
    The main thing is that an "oscillator" has two states (say
    capacitor voltage and inductor current, or pendulum height and
    speed), and from any initial condition we end up with a stable,
    periodic oscillation. Then, plotting one against the other in a
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_portrait,phase portrait], we
    see a limit cycle. That is, a repetitive, periodic trajectory of
    states that attract a range of initial conditions.

    <div class="box-text">

      The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Pol_oscillator,Van der
      Pol oscillator] is a good
      [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_problem,toy problem] for
      synchronization:
      
      $$ \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}-\mu \left(1-x^2 \right) \frac{dx}{dt} + x =
      0 $$

      If $x$ is one state and $y$ is the other, then two state
      equations are $dx/dt=y$ and $dy/dt=\mu(1-x^2)y-x$.  Code to
      integrate these equations is below (edit, then ctrl-enter to
      run). It is instructive, for example, to change the nonlinearity
      parameter (i.e., the nonlinear damping), $\mu$, and note how $x$
      and $y$ are become nearly sinusoidal for $\mu \ll 1$.

      shows the evolution of the two coordinates of the black dot

      consider quasi-linear operation with $\mu<1$ --- where the limit
      cycle tends towards the grey circle.

  <h3>External Force</h3>


      
     

  
  <div class="left_col">

    An "enternal force" on an oscillator is something that disturbs its
    trajectory in the phase space. In practical terms, for instance, electronic 
    oscillators are often disturbed by coupling via finite ground
    impedances. 

  </div>

  <div class="right_col">

    Note, though, that this is different from Huygens classic
    example of two coupled clocks --- in this case the oscillators (clocks)
    mutually affect each other. The influence of an external force is
    thus only in one direction -- the oscillator does not affect the force.

  </div>

  <div class="clear"></div>

  <div class="left_col">
    <h3>Disturbances</h3> The oscillator on the right is quasi-linear
    ($\mu=0.05$). The red and black markers show the evolution of two
    initial conditions. You can
    <span id="dist-stop-button" class="text-button">stop</span> the simulation 
    at any time, reposition the markers, then 
    <span id="dist-start-button" class="text-button">restart</span>.

    To understand the effect of a disturbance on the oscillator it is
    instructive to consider black marker as the nominal solution, and
    the red marker as the perturbed solution (as if knocked off-course
    by an impulse). For examaple, say the nominal (black) solution is
    on the limit cycle, and the perturbation reduces the amplitude by
    half and increases the phase by 45 degrees.

  <h3>Synchronization</h3>

  <div class="left_col">

    We now turn to phase synchronization armed with a critical idea:
    only disturbaces tangential to the limit cycle are important. To
    explore the consequences lets consider the effect of a vertical,
    sinusoidal disturbance on the circular limit-cycle on the right
    (shown as a vertical arrow).

    The period of the disturbance matches the oscillator (the time
    taken to traverse the limit-cycle)---but the *phase* of the
    disturbance is arbitrary. The red marker shows the point where the
    disturbance has a positive peak (i.e., shows the phase of the
    disturbance relative to the limit-cycle). The green trace shows
    the tangential disturbance, which either encourages the oscillator
    phase to move in a clockwise, or anti-clockwise, direction.

    To make things easy, lets decouple the distubance from the
    oscillator and study the effect that it *would* have as we vary
    its phase. If we first [reset] the oscillator so that the peak
    disturbance is at point A, it is visually obvious (from the arrow
    as it traverses the limit cycle) that the oscillator phase would
    be pulled in a clockwise direction.

  </div>

  <div class="right_col">

    <span id="osc-start-button" class="text-button">oscillate!</span>
    <span id="osc-stop-button" class="text-button">stop osc!</span>

    Lets assume then that the [oscillator increses by phase 45
    degrees] -- as a result of the disturbance. Now the green
    trace---which was previously entirely negative---is no partly
    positive. Averaged over the course of a full cycle there is less
    anti-clockwise force from the disturbance than before.

    What if we increase the oscillator phase by a [further 90
    degrees]? Now we see that the green trace is mostly positive!
    Indicating a net clock-wise force on the oscillator phase over a
    full cycle. Clearly, the oscillator phase is being encouraged by
    the disturbance to a point where the [average force over a full
    period is zero].

    It is instructive to increment the oscillator phase
    <span id="osc-cw-button" class="text-button">clockwise</span>
    or <span id="osc-acw-button"
    class="text-button">anti-clockwise</span> and observe the green
    trace.  In every case the oscillator phase is encouraged back to
    the same point.

    Thus, whatever the phase of the oscillator is initially relative
    to the disturbance, the disturbance will encourage the oscillator
    to a fixed phase---in this case, so that the oscillator is at the
    top of the limit-cycle when the disturbance has its peak positive
    value. In other words, the oscillator phase-locks to the
    disturbance.
